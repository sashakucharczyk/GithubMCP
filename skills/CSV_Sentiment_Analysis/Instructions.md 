# Sentiment Analysis Skill — Instructions

This skill reads a CSV file and assigns a sentiment score and reasoning to each row based on a specified text column.

## Purpose
To classify natural-language text into sentiment categories defined by the user, using contextual, human-like interpretation rather than rule-based or keyword-based logic.

## What This Skill Does
- Reads each row from a CSV.
- Interprets the text in a specified input column.
- Assigns exactly one sentiment label per row.
- Writes a new CSV with:
  - the original columns (unchanged)
  - a sentiment label column
  - a reasoning column

## What You (the LLM) Must Do
When annotating rows:
1. Read the text as natural language.
2. Infer sentiment using contextual understanding.
3. Write:
   - A sentiment label from the user-defined scale.
   - A short reasoning (1–2 sentences) grounded in the row’s text.

## Hard Rules
These rules override all other considerations:

### 🍂 **Forbidden Approaches**
You may **NOT**:
- create new source code files  
- modify existing source code files  
- use predefined sentiment lexicons  
- use keyword lists or token-matching  
- implement algorithms, scoring functions, or rule systems  
- compute hidden numeric scores  
- rely on pattern templates for reasoning  
- generate summaries or commentary outside the output CSV  

### 🌿 **Required Behavior**
- Sentiment must be based on *meaning*, not word presence.
- Reasoning must be *row-specific*, not templated.
- Output must preserve:
  - row order
  - original columns
  - CSV formatting integrity

## Output Format Requirements
The final CSV must append two new columns:

1. `Sentiment`
2. `Reasoning`

Each row must have exactly one sentiment label.

## Notes
- The sentiment labels (e.g., 1–5, or custom strings) will be specified by the user at runtime.
- All file paths and driver-level instructions are defined in `sentiment_driver.py`.
