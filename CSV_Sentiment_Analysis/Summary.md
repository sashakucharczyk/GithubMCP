# CSV Sentiment Analysis

## Goal:
Tools allow contextual analysis of multiple reviews/comments in a csv file. 

## Assumptions:
Instruction files assume use of Codex Web. The Instructions will be referenced as a variable name in any prompt to the LLM.

## Use Cases:
Have a large list of reviews and want to have them analyzed/grouped by general tone. Better accuracy than a key word search or similar.
